## Syntax

```css
position: static;
position: relative;
position: absolute;
position: fixed;
position: sticky;

/* Global values */
position: inherit;
position: initial;
position: revert;
position: revert-layer;
position: unset;
```

# Static 

- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The [top"](./top"), [right"](./right"), [bottom"](./bottom"), [left"](./left"), and [z-index"](./z-index") properties have _no effect_. This is the default value.

```css,playground
.target {
        position: static;
        left: 50px; 
        top: 50px;
}
```
# Relative

- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset _relative to itself_ based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were `static`.

```css,playground
.target {
        position: relative;
        left: 50px; 
        top: 50px;
}
```

# Absolute

- The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.

```css,playground
.target {
        position: absolute;
        left: 50px; 
        top: 50px;
}
```

# Fixed 

- The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block.

```css,playground
.target {
        position: fixed;
        left: 50px; 
        top: 50px;
}
```

# Sticky 

- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its _nearest scrolling ancestor_ and containing block.

```css,playground
.target {
        position: sticky;
        top: 50px;
}
```
